Various config files for the AtGames Legends QuadPlay 4 player control deck for OneSaUCE.  So far, I have only done sdl2 mappings - I will start working on and testing udev in the coming days.  

Place the following in your content\retrofe directory
- controls.conf
- gamecontrollerdb.txt
- gamecontrollerpref.txt

Place retroarch.cfg in content\retrofe\retroarch

Place the Atgames QuadPlay PX.cfg files in content\retrofe\retroarch\autoconfig\sdl2
