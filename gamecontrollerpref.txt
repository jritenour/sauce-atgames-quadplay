# Specify game controller names here in preferred order.
# If connected, these controllers will be mapped to port 1, port 2, etc.
# Game controller names can be found in the logs, e.g., the following line
#
#   device=/dev/input/event3 name=HID 0838:8918
#
# indicates that the name of that controller is HID 0838:8918.
# Note that this is only a list of controllers that you prefer to map to
# the first ports. Controllers not listed here will still be mapped. The 
# order then depends on their corresponding device file names.
